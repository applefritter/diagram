<h3>Server</h3>

<p>
  A web page is sent <em>from</em> a <strong>server</strong> -- a physical computer much like a PC/laptop.
  <br>Servers are connected to the Internet and accept requests for web pages. e.g. requests from web-browsers.
</p>

<p>
  When a request comes in, the server processes that request and sends back some content that will make up the web-page you see.
</p>

<p>
  The simplest way for a server to return a reponse is to return the content of a static file on the server.
  This type of server is known as a <strong>Static Server</strong> or static asset server.
