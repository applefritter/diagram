<h3>Server</h3>

<p>
  A web page is sent <em>from</em> a <strong>server</strong> -- a physical computer much like a PC/laptop.
  <br>Servers are connected to the Internet and accept requests for web pages.
</p>

<p>
  When a request comes in, the server processes that request and sends back content that will make up the web-page you see.
