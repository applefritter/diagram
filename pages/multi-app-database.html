<h3>Multi-app Database</h3>
<p>
  Notice it is now <em>necessary</em> to have a dedicated database-server because it is the only way to have persistent data across all app-servers.
</p>
<p>
  This solves the case where a user's request will be handled by app1 first, then another request is handled by app2; we want his data to be the same in both situations.
