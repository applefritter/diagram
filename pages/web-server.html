<h3>Web Server</h3>
<p>Within the Server, software called a <strong>web-server</strong> is run to tell the computer which files are OK to make available to requests over the public internet .</p>
<p>NOTE: 'web-server' in this case is a <em>software program</em> running <em>on</em> a server (computer). </p>
<p>Without the web-server, there would be no way to allow or deny access to files on your server.</p>
