<h3>Web Server</h3>

<p>
  If you hooked up your laptop to the Internet, it's very unlikely you want <em>every</em> file and program to be publicly accessible.
</p>

<p>
  Servers run a software program called a <strong>web-server</strong> that dictates which files and programs are OK to to be accessed from the Internet.
</p>

<p>
  When requests come in they are handled <em>only</em> by the web-server which acts as a kind of security gate.
