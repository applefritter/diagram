<h3>Database</h3>

<p>
  A web application program typically interacts with a <em>database</em>.
</p>
<p>
  A database is a software program that may be installed on the server to help with efficiently storing and accessing data.
</p>
<p>
  We can use a database to store Amazon's millions of products as data: 
</p>
<ul>
  <li>description</li>
  <li>price</li>
  <li>sizes</li>
  <li>images</li>
</ul>
<p>
  A web application can use this database to <em>dynamically</em> create product pages by populating a pre-made template with product data fetched from the database.
