<h3>multi app architecture</h3>
<p>Let's add a 3rd server or <em>node</em> just for kicks =).</p>
<p>
  Notice how it is now <em>necessary</em> that we have a dedicated database-server because it is the only way to have persistent data across all app-servers.
  This solves the case where a user's request will be handled by app1 first, then another request is handled by app2, we want his data to be the same in both situations.
