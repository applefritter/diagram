<h3>Multi-app Architecture</h3>
<p>
  Here we've added another app-server into our server pool.
  The reverse-proxy proxies requests to our app servers "behind the scenes".
</p>
<p>If one server can only serve say 100k requests, rather than buy a more powerful server, we can just add an additional commodity server and we can now serve 100k*2 requests.</p>
