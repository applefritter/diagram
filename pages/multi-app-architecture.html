<h3>Multi-app Architecture</h3>
<p>
  Here we add another app-server into our server pool.
  The reverse-proxy proxies requests to our app servers transparently behind the scenes.
</p>

<p>
  Scaling horizontally is usually very cost effective because it's cheaper to buy many commodity servers than a few powerful servers.
</p>

<p>
  It also mitigates risk; if you only have one powerful server and it fails, your site goes down. Many servers means some can fail and the others will pick up the load.
