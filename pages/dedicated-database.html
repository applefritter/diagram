<h3>Dedicated Database</h3>
<p>
  As your website grows more popular, you might need more processing power to help with the load.
  One option is to move your database software to its own dedicated server. 
  In this way your app server can concentrate on serving web-requests, while your database-server gets more computing power to manage the database.
