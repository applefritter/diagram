<h3>Dedicated Database</h3>
<p>
  Up until this point, all our software programs have been running on <em>one</em> physical server.
  As your website gains popularity, you will need more processing power to help with the load.
</p>
<p>
  One option is to move your database software to its own <strong>dedicated server</strong>.   
</p>

<p>
  Now your app server can concentrate on serving web-requests, while your database-server gets more computing power to manage the database.
