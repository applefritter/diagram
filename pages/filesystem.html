<h3>Serving Content</h3>
<p>Once the web-server software is configured, you can point it to a folder with files in it and the web-server will serve the contents of those files directly to the public Internet.</p>
<p>Ex: mywebsite.com/essays/hell-world.html. The web-server know that mywebsite.com should look in the 'websites' folder, for the sub-folder 'essays' and serve the file 'hello-world.html'.</p>
