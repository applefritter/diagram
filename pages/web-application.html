<h3>Web Application</h3>
<p>
  Serving static files from the filesystem is really fast but it does not scale.
</p>
<p>
  Consider that amazon.com displays millions of products; creating millions of static files would take forever and be hard to maintain.
</p>

<p>
  Instead the web-server can be configured to serve an <strong>application</strong> instead of static files.
  An application (web-app) is a software program that responds to web requests (sent from the web-server).
  An application generates <em>dynamic</em> responses based on the input you feed into it.
