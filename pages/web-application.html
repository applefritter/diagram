<h3>Web Application</h3>
<p>A website like Amazon.com has millions of product pages so it would be inefficient to create millions of redundant static files and store them on a server in the normal way.</p>
<p>Instead the web-server can be configured to serve an <em>application</em> which can respond to arbitrary requests (not just paths to files) and generate <em>dynamic</em> content on the fly.</p>
