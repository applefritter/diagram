<h3>Web Application</h3>
<p>
  Serving files from the filesystem is really fast but makes it hard to serve <em>dynamic</em> content.
</p>

<p>
  Consider that amazon.com displays millions of products; creating millions of static files would take forever and be hard to maintain.
</p>

<p>
  Instead the web-server can serve an <strong>application</strong> (web-app) rather than files.
  The web-server routes the web-request to the web-application software program.
</p>

<p>
  An application can still interact with the filesystem but it can manipulate the content to generate <em>dynamic</em> responses for per individual request.
